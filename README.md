if you need a basic boilerplate of django rest api and serializer this is the best repo that you can clone

- No unnecessary stylig with css bootstrap or anything
- No complex code

### in order to start doing this project just make a virtual environment

In your root folder open terminal from your vscode text editor by pressing Ctrl + ` on your windoes pc (I am not a mac user do i dont know about mac ðŸ˜‰)

make a virtual environment using this command

- Python -m venv (your virtual env name withut brackets)
  In order to activate virtual environment type cd (your virtualenv name)/Scripts/activate
  There is an activate.bat somewhere in the Scripts folder of your virtual env directory so you just need to run it and that will activate the virtual environment
- type "pip install django" which will install django"
  and then copy all things which are inside the main folder of mine and paste it to your root folder. ðŸ˜Š

It should run that way. and yes you can always deactivate virtual env by going inside scripts folder and in terminal/cmd typing "deactivate" and hitting enter on windows.
